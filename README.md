Simple Symfony 6.3 app for exchanging money. 

Project is dockerized and should be easy to set up locally. Just need to clone itself to your local and just execute commands:

````
make start
make migrate
````

Then app should be available for you in your browser on the URL: http://localhost:9001/

There are also some extra prometheus metrics available on the URL: http://localhost:9001/metrics/prometheus
